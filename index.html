        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Cobra Kai is a company and karate dojo founded in the 1970s by John Kreese, who served as president from 1979
            to 1985. Cobrai Kai trained multiple karate stars who won the famous All-Valley Karate championship styles.
            In
            1985, Cobra Kai was issued a lifetime ban from the All Valley Tournament and shut down. More than 3 decades
            later,
            Cobra Kai was reopened. Currently, Vietnam War vet Terry Silver runs and is the president of Cobra Kai.</p>

        <h1>Cobra Kai's Philosophy</h1>
        <div id="philosophy-div">
            <p>Cobra Kai's philosophy is one of strength, power, and domination. Our slogan is
                "strike first, strike hard,
                no mercy." In a ring and a street fight, there is no room for mercy or pity. Your opponent is your
                enemy, and you must esnsure you
                triumph. By striking first and striking hard, you secure your victory and make sure your enemy has no
                chance
                to fight back. Apply this philosophy to your life and you will push your boundaries, fear nothing, and
                experience achievement and success at any cost. The world isn't going to give you what you
                want, so your
                only choice is to take it yourself.
            </p>
